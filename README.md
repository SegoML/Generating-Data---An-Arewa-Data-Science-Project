# Mofolo Clinic Hypertension Data Analysis

This project is a data generation and visualization exercise focused on understanding hypertension prevalence at Mofolo Clinic. The goal is to generate a synthetic dataset of patient records, including various chronic conditions, while emphasizing the 55-65 age group, where hypertension risk is typically higher. 

Key Python libraries used include:

*   **NumPy:** For generating numerical data and arrays.
*   **Pandas:** For structuring and manipulating data into DataFrames.
*   **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating informative data visualizations like histograms, bar charts, box plots, and heatmaps.

The project covers:

*   Simulating patient demographics and disease prevalence.
*   Filtering and analyzing specific populations based on age.
*   Visualizing key relationships and trends through various chart types.

This project is designed to be a practical learning example demonstrating how to generate, manipulate, and present data effectively using Python tools. It explores ways to analyze trends and relationships within a patient dataset focused on hypertension, but also other chronic diseases.
